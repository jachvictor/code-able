        "JavaScript (JS) is a prototype base, high level, interpreted, multi-paradigm, single-threaded dynamic. To break all this down, JavaScript being prototype base means it allows machine of object without first defining its classes. It has lots of abstraction so you don't have to deal with memory management and co as a high-level language, by interpreted language it means it runs without compilation and can be written as either an object oriented or functional programming as a multi paradigm language. JavaScript also runs only one line of code at any given time as a single threaded language and finally, as a dynamic language; the interpreter assigns a type of variable at runtime based on the variable value at that time",

      "First of all, a variable is a pointer to a data stored in a memory, we use variables to store data temporally in the computer's memory. Thera are three ways to declare a variable, by the use of the keywords; var, let and const. Before let and const, there was already var. One of the features that came with the newJavaScript edition (ES6) is the addition of let and const , which can be used for variable declaration. In this article, we'll discuss the difference between var ,let and const with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting.",
